Until I find a way to patch the kernel from a device tree in a nice way,
I will put modified source in this directory.
Just copy them to the kernel tree.

kernel/drivers/platform/x86/asus-laptop.c 
kernel/kernel/power/suspend.c

delete folder hardware/libsensors


Kernel modules are now in wetab tree, and will be compiled during normal make

#hid-multitouch: still needed for real dual-touch
asus-laptop:    needed for autorotate
wakeup_button:  needed for correct resume
